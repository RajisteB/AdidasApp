## Adidas Sneaker Product Page
After having an API deprecated from an earlier ecommerce project, I decided to do something similar but this time with a single product as most shopping/ecommerce API's hold data on almost way too many items at times. Additionally, it is quite difficult to find an ecommerce or shopping API for clothes/accessories without having to first sign-up as a partner or affiliate of the site or brand. Notably, many of these API's data is not organized efficiently, so any project requires some manipulation of the data response. Regardless, I choose to do an Adidas sneaker product which, at this time is wildly popular.

## Planning & Design
For the design, I once again used AdobeXD to first draw out a low-fidelty wireframe and then added in some visuals to create a high-fidelity wireframe.
